<h1 style="text-align: center">The Stolen Child</h1>
<h2 style="text-align: center">By William Butler Yeats</h2>
<p style="text-align: center">"Where dips the rocky highland<br/>
Of sleuth wood in the lake, <br/>
There lies a leafy island<br/>
Where flapping herons wake<br/>
the drowsy water-rats;<br/>
here we've hid our faery vats,<br/>
Full of berries<br/>
And of reddest stolen cherries.<br/>
Come away, O human child!<br/>
To the waters and the wild<br/>
    With a faery, hand in hand,<br/>
For the world's more full of weeping than you can understand.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">" Where the wave of moonlight glosses<br/>
The dim grey sands with light,<br/>
Far off by furthest Rosses<br/>
We foot it all the night,<br/>
Weaving olden dances,<br/>
Mingling hands and mingling glances<br/>
Till the moon has taken flight;<br/>
To and fro we leap<br/>
And chase the frothy bubbles,<br/>
While the world is full of troubles<br/>
And is anxious in its sleep.<br/>
Come away, O human child!<br/>
To the waters and the wild<br/>
With a faery, hand in hand,<br/>
For the world's morefully of weeping than you can understand. </p>
<p style="text-align: center">"Where the wandering water gushes,<br/>
From the hills above Glen-Car,.,<br/>
In pools among the rushes,<br/>
That scarce could bathe a star,,<br/>
We seek for slumbering trout,<br/>
And whispering in their ears,<br/>
Give them unquiet dreams;,<br/>
Leaning softly out,<br/>
From ferns that drop their tears,<br/>
Over the young streams.,<br/>
Come away, O human child!,<br/>
To the waters and the wild,<br/>
With a faery, hand in hand,,<br/>
For to world's morefully of weeping than you can understand.</p>
    
<p style="text-align: center">"Away with us he's going,<br/>
The solemn-eyed:<br/>
He'll hear no more the lowing<br/>
Of the calves on the warm hillside<br/>
Or the kettle on the hob<br/>
Sing peace into his breast,<br/>
Or see the brown mice bob<br/>
Round and round the oatmeal-chest.<br/>
For he comes, the human child,<br/>
To the waters and the wild<br/>
With a faery, hand in hand,<br/>
from a world more full of weeping than you can understand.
